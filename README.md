Hello dear connections,



I am thrilled to share that I have completed the "Mvc5 ile Sıfırdan Admin Panelli Dinamik CV Sitesi" course, created by Murat Yücedağ on Udemy, as part of the Full Stack .Net Core Development Bootcamp at M&Y Yazılım Eğitim Akademi Danışmanlık. Combining the knowledge I gained from the course with my own expertise, I have successfully completed my project.

Modal Popup Integration 🔲: Adding new data via Modal Popup in the admin panel.

Contact Page Messaging ✉️: Users can send messages to the admin via the Contact Page on the UI.
